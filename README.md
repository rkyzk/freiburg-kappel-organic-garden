# Freiburg Kappel Organic Garden

## Description: 
* This web application introduces Freiburg Kappel Organic Garden, where flowers are grown organically and visitors are welcomed throughout the year. 

* On the web pages readers can see various photos of the garden and get information about the events as well as directions to the garden. The contact page offers a form, with which readers should be able to sign up for the events, or send messages to personnel. The input data will not be sent to a database, but the function will be implemented in the future.

## Features
### Navigation (Common for all three pages)
![Navigation](assets/images/readme/navigation.png)
* The navigation shows the name of the garden in the left corner: Freiburg Kappel Organic Garden, which links to the top of “Home” page. 
* Just below that, the navigation menu is placed, offering links to different pages: Home, Events and Contact.  
* The dark blue color of the menu makes the white letters easily readable.  
* The navigation clearly tells the name of the website, which is also the name of the garden.  
* The titles of all three pages are clearly defined so users can easily access the information they need.     

### "Home" page
